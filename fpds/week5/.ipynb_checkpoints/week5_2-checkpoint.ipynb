    "## Fundamental Signal Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two fundamental operations over signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain the value of the signal at the current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our library this is expressed by `()` application.\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "mousePosition() // the current mouse position\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Define a signal in terms of other signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our library, this is expressed by the Signal constructor.\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def inReactangle(LL: Position, UR: Position): Signal[Boolean] =\n",
    "Signal {\n",
    "val pos = mousePosition()\n",
    "LL <= pos && pos <= UR\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Constant Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Signal(...)` syntax can also be used to define a signal that has always the same value:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val sig = Signal(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Signals\n",
    "* Values of type Signal are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But our library also defines a subclass Var of Signal for signals that can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Var` class provides an `update` operation, which allows to redefine the value of a signal from the current time on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val sig = Var(3)\n",
    "sig.update(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, calls to update can be written as assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, for an array `arr`\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "arr(i) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "is translated to\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "arr.update(i, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which calls an update method which can be thought of as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Array[T] {\n",
    "def update(idx: Int, value: T): Unit\n",
    "...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, an indexed assignment like $f(E1, ..., En) = E$ is translated to $f.update(E1, ..., En, E)$.\n",
    "This works also if $n = 0$: $f() = E$ is shorthand for $f.update(E).$\n",
    "Hence,\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "sig.update(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "can be abbreviated to\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "sig() = 5\n",
    "```"
